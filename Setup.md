In order to be able to compile the solution, you have to add your local AutoCAD installation folder to the reference paths of each project.

As an example, let's assume your AutoCAD installation folder is *C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2016*. To add the reference paths, open the solution, open the project properties, select the tab *Reference Paths* and add the folder *C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2016*. Do this for both projects, Linq2Acad and Linq2Acad.Tests.
